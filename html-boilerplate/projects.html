    <h3> StockMaster</h3>
    <p> This is my first big Java project. It is a GUI program 
        with <em> Java and Swing framework</em> that emulates the stock market and allows
         users to buy or sell ~1000 stocks of their choice. It uses a <em>SQL database </em>
          for login and user authentification purposes as well as keeping track of 
          user's balances and stock inventory.</p>

            The app support operations such as buying/selling stocks, 
            depositing and retracting funds(not real funds).The app 
            allow user to <strong> research stocks</strong> and provide the current price as well as a graph(using the 
            <em>JfreeChart library</em> ) made of the <em> historical data </em>from up to 1Year. The app use the Jsoup library to parse through the HTML link from the google finance website. To do this I built a Web-Scrapper and used the JSoup library to automatically 
            fetch and assemble <em>real time data </em> of the stock prices from the <em> Google Finance </em>website every 5 seconds
